# Responsive Containers
<!-- /ignore -->

## Description

[CSS media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) let us style elements based on the size of the screen. What if we wanted to style them based on the size of their **container**? A widget or block should often look different if it's full-width or constrained within a column or sidebar, but we didn't have any way to write **container queries** to style those elements based on their on-screen width&hellip; until now!

This plugin loads a small JavaScript file that conditionally applies classes to elements based on how wide those elements are in the browser. This can be used by other themes and plugins to write container-specific styles for editor blocks or widgets, so that they will display correctly wherever they are placed in the page.

The script works on the frontend and in the block editor â€” see your responsive styles live while you're composing your post, and trust that your widgets and blocks will look their best whether they're full-width or in the narrowest sidebar.

### Usage

If you have a block or widget in your site that you wish to use as a responsive container, add the `data-responsive-container` attribute to that block's container element. For example, the parent `<div>` for a calendar block might look like this:

```html
<div class="calendar-block" data-responsive-container>
```

By adding that data-attribute and nothing more, your container will now be tagged with additional classes based on how big they appear:
- `container-sm` if the container is 419px wide or less,
- `container-md` if it is between 420px and 767px wide,
- `container-lg` if it is between 768px and 1023px wide, and
- `container-xl` for any element 1024px or wider.

These are default values and therefore somewhat arbitrary, so you may also provide your own custom theme- or plugin-specific breakpoint values using the `data-responsive-container` attribute. When rendering your element or block in PHP, pass an array of **class names** and the **minimum width** at which each class should be applied. These class names can be generic like the default `.container-*` classes, or they may be specific to the element being styled:

```php
echo sprintf(
  '<div class="myblock" data-responsive-container="%s">',
  // responsive_container_breakpoints() calls esc_attr internally.
  responsive_container_breakpoints( [
    'myblock--2-column' => 600,
    'myblock--3-column' => 900,
  ] )
);
```

In this example your container would receive the `.myblock--2-column` class from 600px to 899px, and `.myblock--3-column` at or above 900px.

Note that in this case the `.myblock` element receives no custom class below 600px. We don't apply any class names below your specified minimum because we assume styles are written mobile-first, but you may ensure your smallest class is always applied by providing a minimum width of `0`:

```php
echo sprintf(
  '<div class="myblock" data-responsive-container="%s">',
  responsive_container_breakpoints( [
    'myblock--1-column' => 0, // Will apply up to 599px.
    'myblock--2-column' => 600,
    'myblock--3-column' => 900,
  ] )
);
```

## Screenshots

1. The same block may be inserted anywhere on the page and will receive different classes depending on the size of their parent. These classes may be used to easily style your blocks for a variety of contexts. In this screenshot you can see that an example "responsive container" block receives the `.container-xl` class when full-width, `.container-sm` when constrained within a narrow column, and so on.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does this work?

The Responsive Containers plugin implements an approach popularized by [Philip Walton's excellent article _Responsive Components: a Solution to the Container Queries Problem_](https://philipwalton.com/articles/responsive-components-a-solution-to-the-container-queries-problem/). What this plugin does is apply his solution to WordPress sites so that, assuming this plugin is installed, any other plugin or theme can opt-in to responsive container styling.

Under the hood this is all driven by [`ResizeObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver), a new browser feature that efficiently detects element size changes. We use this method to track the size of specific containers on the page and apply a set of classes to those elements based on how big they appear on the screen.

### I activated this plugin and nothing changed

Installing and activating this plugin will not change anything about your site on its own. You have to update your theme or plugin to add the `data-responsive-containers` HTML attribute to any elements you wish to use as responsive containers.

## Installation

=== From within WordPress ===

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'
1. Search for 'Responsive Containers'
1. Activate the Responsive Containers plugin from your Plugins page.
1. Start using `data-responsive-container` attributes within your theme or plugin.

=== Manually ===

1. Upload the `responsive-containers` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the Responsive Containers plugin from your Plugins page.
1. Start using `data-responsive-container` attributes within your theme or plugin.

## Changelog

= 1.0 =
* Loads `responsive-containers.js` to observe and decorate `data-responsive-container` elements.
* Introduces `responsive_container_breakpoints()` method to render a stringified & attribute-escaped custom breakpoints array.
